Present Members: Alex S, Alex N, Wilson Q, Tianze C

What we did:
Alex S: 
  Close to finishing 2-3 user stories. 1.02 5.01 5.02 (Just one bug and after should be fine. 
  Bug on call request driver (breaks on null object reference)
  
Wilson
  Finished qr (8.01) and finished 1.10 (was mostly done already) and 1.11. Needs to test however since we would need a separate
  user for driver. 


Tianze
  Finished 7.0.1 (Got location working)
  Would be good to add a distance calculator
  
Alex N
  Close to finishing complete or cancel request. 1.08, 1.04, 1.07
  
Simon
  Has the framework to do notifications mostly done. Stuck on how to make it notify when when something changes in database. 
  Will likely ask TA for help if not solved by Wednesday. 
  
  
For next week or maybe Wednesday:
  Simon
    Change singleton into loggedInUser singleton. 
    
  As group:
    change the request list to just pull driver username. 

Reminders!
  Push and merge working code so we can get updated things! 
  Do the peer review for Part 2 by Friday
